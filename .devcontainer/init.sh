# gpg_mount_json
#
# Emit the mounts[] entry forwarding the host's gnupg runtime directory,
# or nothing at all — which is the default, and the safe answer under
# every driver.
#
# VS Code must never receive this mount. The Dev Containers extension
# forwards the agent itself, and more safely than we could: it relays the
# host's *restricted* S.gpg-agent.extra socket to whatever the container's
# own `gpgconf --list-dirs` reports as agent-socket. Mounting the host
# directory at the same path collapses those two into one file, and the
# extension's relay opens by unlinking the socket it is about to listen
# on. That unlink takes the host's live socket with it; gpg-agent watches
# it with inotify, sees it removed, and shuts down. The host loses its
# agent every time a container starts, with no gpg-agent in the container
# to blame — the listener there is the extension's own relay.
#
# The devcontainer CLI carries none of that logic, so a CLI-driven
# container has no agent unless we mount one. DEV_ENV_GPG_MOUNT asks for
# it. The variable reaches us untouched: the CLI passes its environment
# through verbatim and adds no marker of its own, which is also why the
# driver cannot simply be detected.
#
# ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE only ever refuses, never enables. The extension
# spawns its bundled CLI through the Code binary and injects that
# variable, while VS Code strips ELECTRON_* from integrated-terminal
# environments — so it identifies the extension without mistaking a
# `devcontainer up` typed into VS Code's own terminal for one. It is
# undocumented, and blind when the extension drives a Remote-SSH or WSL
# window (the remote CLI inherits a login shell, so nothing marks it).
# Used as a veto that only bites someone who opted in by hand, that blind
# spot costs a warning; used as the enabler, it would silently restore the
# bug above.
