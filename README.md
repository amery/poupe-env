# Development Environment

A VS Code DevContainer configuration that provides isolated, reproducible
development environments with intelligent host integration.

## Features

- **Isolated Environment**: Container with sandboxed home directory to
  prevent pollution of host home
- **Claude AI Integration**: Automatic bind mounts for `.claude` config
  and state persistence
- **Smart Mount System**: Selective bind mounts preserve tool configurations
  while isolating the container
- **Automatic Setup**: Self-configuring initialization script
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different host systems

## Base Image

The development container is built on
[amery/docker-builder](https://github.com/amery/docker-builder), extending
the `docker-ubuntu-vsc-base-builder` image with:

- **Go**: Full Go development environment
- **Node.js**: JavaScript/TypeScript runtime and tooling
- **VS Code Server**: Pre-configured for DevContainer support
- **Build Tools**: Essential compilation and development utilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- Visual Studio Code with "Dev Containers" extension
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive <repository-url>
   cd dev-env
   code .
   ```

2. When VS Code opens, click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   (or use Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")

The container will automatically initialize on first run. The init.sh script
runs on your host machine to create necessary directories and configure
mounts for Claude AI integration. The script dynamically generates a custom
Dockerfile with user-specific metadata and merges mount configurations into
the devcontainer.json file.

## Project Structure

```text
.devcontainer/        # VS Code DevContainer configuration
├── devcontainer.json # Container settings and mounts (auto-updated)
├── Dockerfile        # Auto-generated by init.sh
└── init.sh          # Initialization script with JSON merge capability

.docker-run-cache/   # Container runtime storage (git-ignored)
└── ${HOME}/        # Sandboxed home directory

docker/              # Base container definitions
├── Dockerfile       # Base image configuration
└── run.sh          # Container runtime script

bin/                 # Helper scripts
└── x               # Workspace helper (detection & container access)

run.sh              # Symlink to docker/run.sh (workspace root marker)
go.work             # Go workspace configuration
```

## The `x` Helper

The `x` script in `bin/` provides intelligent workspace detection and
command execution:

### Usage

```bash
# Find workspace root
x --root

# Execute command in container (if run.sh exists)
x make build

# Pass through command if no run.sh found
x echo "hello"
```

### How it Works

1. **Workspace Detection**: Searches for `run.sh` by checking:
   - `.repo` directory (for repo tool workspaces)
   - `.git` repository root
   - Parent directories up to root

2. **Container Execution**: If `run.sh` is found, trampolines commands
   through it for consistent container-based execution

3. **Fallback**: If no `run.sh` is found, executes commands directly

## Usage Examples

### Working with Go Projects

```bash
# From any subdirectory, use x to run commands in container
cd src/myapp
x go build ./...
x go test -v

# Check workspace root
x --root
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Open in VS Code with DevContainer
code .

# After container starts, your tools are available
go version      # Uses container's Go installation
make build      # Runs in consistent environment

# Claude AI config persists between sessions
claude --help   # If Claude CLI is installed
```

## Environment Variables

The container sets these environment variables:

- `WS`: Workspace folder path
- `CURDIR`: Current directory (same as workspace)
- `GOPATH`: Go path (set to workspace for Go projects)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Reopen in Container" not appearing**: Ensure Docker is running and
  the Dev Containers extension is installed in VS Code
- **Mount permission errors**: Run `git status` to ensure the repository
  is clean, then rebuild the container
- **Claude configuration not persisting**: Ensure the init script ran
  successfully (it creates `~/.claude` if needed)

### Rebuilding the Container

If you encounter issues, try rebuilding:

1. **Quick Rebuild**: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
   - Reuses cached Docker layers when possible
   - Faster but may not pick up base image updates

2. **Clean Rebuild**: Command Palette → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container
   Without Cache"
   - Removes all cached layers and rebuilds from scratch
   - Downloads latest base image updates
   - Ensures you have the newest versions of Go, Node.js, and tools

You can also access these options from VS Code's UI:
- Click the remote indicator (bottom-left corner)
- Select "Rebuild Container" or "Rebuild Container Without Cache"
